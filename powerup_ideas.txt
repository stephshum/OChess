Power-up Ideas


General Requirements:
-Power-ups can not be placed in a void or where there is a piece. If there is neither a void or a piece, it is called a ‘valid space’.
-Will need to check after each movement whether there is a power-up on the spot you land on.
-Kings may not receive power-ups. A king may land on that space, but they will not receive the power-up. The power-up will still remain valid.


***Raise the Dead***
Description:
-“Bring back” three pawns in front of you if there exists three valid spaces that are one space in front, one space to the top left, and one space to the top right. Does NOT require three captured pawns.

Requires:
-The power-up cannot be placed in the second to last or first to last row to the end.

Implementation:
-Keep track of the color and position of the piece that lands on the power-up.
-Check the three spaces in front of the power-up, and see whether it is valid.
-Create at most three new pawns, which will go in the three spaces in front of the power-up if they are valid.

***Elimination***
Description:
-Eliminates a whole column of pieces.

Requires:
-The power-up cannot be placed in the column that the kings start on 	originally.

Implementation:
-If an opponent’s piece is able to get the power-up, the king may not move into the column containing the power-up.
-The player may not use the power-up if their king is in the same column as the power-up.
-Remove each piece from ‘pieces’ that has the same column coordinate as the power-up.
-Add the removed piece to ‘captured’.
*********************


***No Jumpers***
Description:
-Takes all of the jumpers off of the board.

Requires:
-None

Implementation:
-Iterate through ‘pieces’. If the ‘pattern’ of a piece contains a ‘Jump’, remove the piece from ‘pieces’.
-Add each removed piece to ‘captured’.

Implementation:
-If an opponent’s piece is able to get the power-up, the king may not move into the nearby circle containing the power-up.

-Remove each piece from ‘pieces’ that has the same coordinates as the nearby circle of the power-up.
-Add the removed pieces to ‘captured’.

/////////////////////////////Will not implement///////////////////////////////////
***Capture the Flag***
power-up is randomly bestowed onto a piece--> if the other team eats this piece, its like capturing a king

***Confusion***
make all of the pieces within one block unable to move for two turns

***Second Chance Hard Version***
once this piece dies, the opponent has to revive it but is allowed to choose where to put it
/////////////////////////////Will not implement///////////////////////////////////
