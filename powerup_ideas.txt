powerup ideas

raise the dead
bring back three pawns in front of you if valid spaces, if they are empty and not in the last row

elimination
eliminations a whole column of pieces

no jumpers
takes all of the jumpers off of the board

second chance
once this piece dies, the opponent has to revive it but is allowed to choose where to put it
easier version is pick any piece to revive

clone
make a copy of a piece on the board

mind control
steal a piece from the other guy

kings cannot get power ups

cult murder
kill every near by in the circle

/////////////////////////////Will not implement///////////////////////////////////
//capture the flag
powerup is randomly bestowed onto a piece--> if the other team eats this piece, its like capturing a king
//confusion
make all of the pieces within one block unable to move for two turns
